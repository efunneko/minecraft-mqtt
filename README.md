# minecraft-mqtt

Experiment with inserting an MQTT tunnel between Minecraft clients and a server. This enables a number of things:

1. Can use a Cloud based MQTT broker to easily connect Minecraft players without needing any port forwarding, etc
1. Can snoop on Minecraft packets by subscribing to any desired packets, filtering on clients and packet IDs
